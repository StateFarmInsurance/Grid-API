Grid-API
========

The design for the Grid API came about for a desire to have a responsive grid system that wasn't confined to set number of columns, nor do you need to define how many columns a particular cell takes up. Rather, the number of columns is dictated by the number of cell classes are within a particular parent container. There was also a desire to take this and use it to define a layout as well. Many of the Grid systems in the industry require you to bring in 1000 liner CSS files. The Grid API has only 102 lines of CSS and 13 lines of JavaScript for allowing offsets within the grid; a total of 115 lines of code.
